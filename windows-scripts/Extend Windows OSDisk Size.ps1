<# Notes:

    This script lets you extend/Increase the OS Drive Partition size for any Windows based Machine by adding the entire
    unallocated space available on the OS Disk, if any. This script is particularly useful for extending the OS Drive
    partition for Windows based Azure VM's, after the VM OS Disk size has been Increased from outside the VM using
    PowerShell or Azure Portal. This is so because the Increase in size done for the VM OS Disk from outside does not
    automatically get added to the OS Drive partition, and shows as unallocated space on the OS Disk of the VM. You will
    have to manually extend the OS Drive partition from within the VM OS to add the unallocated space to the OS
    partition. This script helps to automate the same process end-to-end. You need to be already logged into your Azure
    account through PowerShell before calling this script.
